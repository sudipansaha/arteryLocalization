# arteryLocalization

This code is a part of project "Carotid artery localization from B-Mode ultrasound images" which is a part of
my M.Tech. thesis "Ultrasound image processing for CAD and other
applications". This part is described in section 4.1 of my thesis.

Please download the input images in the folder input. <br/>
Then, run "demo.m" to run the project. "demo.m" will call "ArteryDetection.m" 
where the main chunk of the code is implmented. <br/>
Further description of the variables used is given in the comment section at top
of the code.
